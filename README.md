# SVM-Algorithm-Tutorial
Support Vector Machine(SVM Classifier)mostly used in addressing multi-classification problems.
Multi-classification problem means having more than 2 target classes to predict.

We are going to implement SVM classifier on Iris Dataset.
Iris Dataset is one of the most popular classification dataset.

# Required packages-
Sklearn
Numpy
Matplot

DATASET- We are going to import the Iris dataset from Scikit-Learn.
